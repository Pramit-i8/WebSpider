    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <p> Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. A fundamental part of being Spider-Man is that it sucks to be him. 
        Peter is constantly fighting an uphill battle, he is always unlucky and rarely things go his way. He sacrifices his personal life and relationships in order to do the right thing. 
        Even when he does the right thing, he is criticized by someone. There are often times when Peter thinks about giving up his hero days but he always comes back knowing he has a responsibility to help others.
        The reason why Spider-Man is so popular is because we can all relate to him. Under the mask and superhero fantasy character, he is just like us down on our luck struggling but persevering through it all. He reminds us there is a hero in all of us.</p>
